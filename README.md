# Lessons Learned

This project was a fun learning experience, being able to transition from React to Next.js was an eye-opener in terms of project structure and optimization.

## MongoDB
Working with MongoDB was great and the document structure was a refreshing take compared to the relational databases I am used to from learning at University. Personally, I prefer working with noSQL databases because of how flexible they can be as your project grows in scale but I can still appreciate the rigidity of SQL. I am planning to start a project involving SQL soon to consolidate what my preference.

## Next.js 13
Being new to Next.js meant I could learn it's newest iteration, Next.js 13 without clashing knowledge from Next.js 12 and below. I found working in this fullstack framework so much easier in terms of routing and API integration. This was thanks to its very intuitive project structure. Definitely an upgrade over plain old react!

## TailwindCSS
Nothing new to say about my favourite CSS framework. Once I started I couldn't stop. Thankfully it's implementation was as smooth as butter on Next.js 13 and styling has never been so effortless.
